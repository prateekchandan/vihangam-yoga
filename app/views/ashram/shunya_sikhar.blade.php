                                <h3>How to Reach<br>
                                <small>** The charges are only indicative. It may vary during journey.</small></h3>
								<p>The Closest Railway Station from Ashram is Kotdwara. Travelers can board Mussorie Express (Train No - 4041) from Delhi to reach Kotdwara. Buses from Delhi are also available. The approximate time of journey is 6 hrs.<p>

								<p><strong>Note:</strong><i> It is highly recommended that every traveler must refresh in the train itself, as there is lack of refreshment facility in Kotdwara.</i></p>

								<p>After reaching Kotdwara, one needs to get the jeep from Jhanda Chowk. Jeeps are generally available after 8 AM. The jeep drops the traveler to Balli. The charges are around 50 Rupees / Person. You can also book the complete jeep for the journey to Balli. It costs around 350 Rupees.</p>

								<p>After reaching Balli, the travelers must keep their luggage in the safe custody of the mule owner. There is only one mule owner - Puran Singh, one of the young girls who keeps the luggage in the shade and is responsible for bringing the luggage of travelers to the Ashram. She generally charges Rs.100/- per mule. With the luggage safely handed over, now the traveler is free to start the journey on foot towards the Ashram from Balli.</p>

								<p><strong>Note:</strong><i> For new travelers it is recommended that they should inform the ashram in advance to meet them in Balli and lead them to their destination.</i></p>

								<p>The foot distance from Balli to Shoonya Shikhar Ashram is 7 Kms. At intervals there are signs of "Aa" marking directing towards the ashram. At some distance from Balli is Idamalla village which is again a renowned landmark leading towards the Ashram.</p>

								<p>In the return journey, traveler needs to follow the same route and preferably one must get the train return tickets booked in advance. The train departs from Kotdwara for Delhi at 10 PM. Buses to Delhi are also available, but fewer. </p>
